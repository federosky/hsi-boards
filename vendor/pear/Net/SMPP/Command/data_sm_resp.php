/**
 * data_sm_resp class
 *
 * This command is used to transfer data between the SMSC and the ESME. It may
 * be used by both the ESME and SMSC.
 *
 * This command is an alternative to the submit_sm and deliver_sm commands. It
 * is introduced as a new command to be used by interactive applications such
 * as those provided via a WAP framework.
 *
 * The ESME may use this command to request the SMSC to transfer a message to
 * an MS. The SMSC may also use this command to transfer an MS originated message
 * to an ESME.
 *
 * In addition, the data_sm operation can be used to transfer the following
 * types of special messages to the ESME:-
 *
 * - SMSC Delivery Receipt.
 * - SME Delivery Acknowledgement. The user data of the SME delivery acknowledgement
 *    is included in the short_message field of the data_sm
 * - SME Manual/User Acknowledgement. The user data of the SME delivery
 *   acknowledgement is included in the short_message field of the data_sm
 * - Intermediate Notification.
